Retrieves a shielded contract instance with extended functionality for performing
shielded write operations, signed reads, and contract interaction.

This function extends the base `getContract` functionality by adding:
- Shielded write actions for `nonpayable` and `payable` functions.
- Signed read actions for `pure` and `view` functions.
- Proxy-based access to dynamically invoke contract methods.

</div>

```ts
getShieldedContract<TTransport,TAddress,TAbi,TClient,TChain,TAccount>(__namedParameters: GetContractParameters<TTransport, TChain, TAccount, TAbi, TClient, TAddress>): GetContractReturnType<TAbi, TClient, TAddress> & SignedReadContractReturnType<TAbi, TClient>
```

<h4 className="doc-comment-title">Returns</h4>

A contract instance with extended shielded write and signed read functionalities.
The returned object includes standard contract methods (`abi`, `address`, `createEventFilter`, etc.)
and shielded-specific methods (`write`, `read`, `sread`).
<h4 className="doc-comment-title">Throws</h4>

If the wallet client is not provided for shielded write or signed read operations.
<h4 className="doc-comment-title">Throws</h4>

If the wallet client does not have an account configured for signed reads.
:::info Example

```typescript
const contract = getShieldedContract({
  abi: myContractAbi,
  address: '0x1234...',
  client: shieldedWalletClient,
});

// Perform a shielded write
await contract.write.myFunction([arg1, arg2], { gas: 50000n });

// Perform a signed read
const value = await contract.sread.getValue();
console.log('Value:', value);
```

<h4 className="doc-comment-title">Remarks</h4>

- The `write` property allows dynamic invocation of `nonpayable` and `payable` functions.
- The `read` property will toggle between public reads and signed reads, depending on whether an `account` is provided
- The `sread` property does the same as `read`, except provides `account` as a parameter (so it always makes a signed read)
- The client must be a `ShieldedWalletClient` or provide a wallet client for shielded-specific operations.
