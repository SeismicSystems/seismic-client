Represents a client configuration that includes either a public client, a wallet client, or both.

This type allows flexibility in defining clients by enabling configurations where:
- Only the `public` client is provided.
- Only the `wallet` client is provided.
- Both `public` and `wallet` clients are provided.

</div>

```ts
type KeyedClient<transport extends Transport = Transport, chain extends Chain | undefined = Chain | undefined, account extends Account | undefined = Account | undefined> = {
  public?: Client<transport, chain>;
  wallet: Client<transport, chain, account>
} | {
  public: Client<transport, chain>;
  wallet?: Client<transport, chain, account>
}
```

<h4 className="doc-comment-title">Remarks</h4>

- The `public` client is used for general-purpose, non-account-specific actions.
- The `wallet` client is used for account-specific operations such as transactions and contract interactions.
:::info Example

```typescript
const keyedClient: KeyedClient<HttpTransport, SeismicChain, LocalAccount> = {
  public: createPublicClient({ transport: httpTransport, chain: seismicChain }),
  wallet: createWalletClient({ transport: httpTransport, chain: seismicChain, account: localAccount }),
};

// Access the public client
const chainId = await keyedClient.public?.getChainId();

// Access the wallet client
const txResult = await keyedClient.wallet?.sendTransaction({ to: '0x1234...', value: 1000n });
```
