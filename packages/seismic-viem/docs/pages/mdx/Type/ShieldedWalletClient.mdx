Represents a shielded wallet client with extended functionality for interacting
with shielded contracts, performing wallet operations, and executing public actions.

</div>

```ts
type ShieldedWalletClient<transport extends Transport = Transport, chain extends Chain | undefined = Chain | undefined, account extends Account | undefined = Account | undefined> = Client<transport, chain, account, RpcSchema, PublicActions<transport, chain, account> & WalletActions<chain, account> & ShieldedWalletActions<chain, account>>
```

<h4 className="doc-comment-title">Remarks</h4>

The `ShieldedWalletClient` extends the base `Client` type by combining public, wallet, and shielded-specific
actions into a single client. It is designed for secure and advanced blockchain interactions that require
encryption and shielded transaction capabilities.
:::info Example

```typescript
const client: ShieldedWalletClient<HttpTransport, SeismicChain, LocalAccount> = createShieldedWalletClient({
  chain: seismicChain,
  transport: httpTransport,
  privateKey: '0xabcdef...',
});

// Access wallet-specific and shielded actions
const writeResult = await client.writeContract({
  address: '0x1234...',
  data: '0xdeadbeef...',
});
const encryptionKey = client.getEncryption();
console.log('Encryption Key:', encryptionKey);
```
