Represents a shielded public client with extended functionality for interacting
with a blockchain network. This client type combines public RPC schema actions
with shielded-specific actions.

</div>

```ts
type ShieldedPublicClient<transport extends Transport = Transport, chain extends Chain | undefined = Chain | undefined, accountOrAddress extends Account | undefined = undefined, rpcSchema extends RpcSchema | undefined = undefined> = Prettify<Client>
```

<h4 className="doc-comment-title">Remarks</h4>

This client is designed to support both standard public actions and shielded-specific actions.
If an additional `rpcSchema` is provided, it is appended to the default `PublicRpcSchema`.
:::info Example

```typescript
const client: ShieldedPublicClient<HttpTransport, SeismicChain, LocalAccount> = createShieldedClient({
  transport: httpTransport,
  chain: seismicChain,
});

// Use the client for shielded actions
const result = await client.shieldedAction(...);
```
