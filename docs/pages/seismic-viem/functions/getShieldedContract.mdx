# Function: getShieldedContract()

```ts
function getShieldedContract<TTransport, TAddress, TAbi, TClient, TChain, TAccount>(__namedParameters): GetContractReturnType<TAbi, TClient, TAddress> & SignedReadContractReturnType<TAbi, TClient>
```

Defined in: [packages/seismic-viem/src/contract/contract.ts:138](https://github.com/SeismicSystems/seismic-client/blob/fb2b70a799e0a58e95478a9bc32d3743c2d88729/packages/seismic-viem/src/contract/contract.ts#L138)

Retrieves a shielded contract instance with extended functionality for performing
shielded write operations, signed reads, and contract interaction.

This function extends the base `getContract` functionality by adding:
- Shielded write actions for `nonpayable` and `payable` functions.
- Signed read actions for `pure` and `view` functions.
- Proxy-based access to dynamically invoke contract methods.

## Type Parameters

• **TTransport** *extends* `Transport`

The transport mechanism used for communication (extends `Transport`).

• **TAddress** *extends* `` `0x${string}` ``

The address type of the contract.

• **TAbi** *extends* `Abi` \| readonly `unknown`[]

The ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the contract, either strict `Abi` or unknown array.

• **TClient** *extends* 
  \| [`ShieldedWalletClient`](/seismic-viem/type-aliases/ShieldedWalletClient.mdx)\<`TTransport`, `TChain`, `TAccount`\>
  \| `KeyedClient`\<`TTransport`, `TChain`, `TAccount`\>

The client type, supporting either a `ShieldedWalletClient` or `KeyedClient`.

• **TChain** *extends* `undefined` \| `Chain` = `undefined` \| `Chain`

The blockchain chain type (extends `Chain` or `undefined`).

• **TAccount** *extends* `undefined` \| `Account` = `undefined` \| `Account`

The account type associated with the wallet client (extends `Account` or `undefined`).

## Parameters

### \_\_namedParameters

`GetContractParameters`\<`TTransport`, `TChain`, `TAccount`, `TAbi`, `TClient`, `TAddress`\>

## Returns

`GetContractReturnType`\<`TAbi`, `TClient`, `TAddress`\> & `SignedReadContractReturnType`\<`TAbi`, `TClient`\>

A contract instance with extended shielded write and signed read functionalities.
The returned object includes standard contract methods (`abi`, `address`, `createEventFilter`, etc.)
and shielded-specific methods (`write`, `read`, `sread`).

## Throws

If the wallet client is not provided for shielded write or signed read operations.

## Throws

If the wallet client does not have an account configured for signed reads.

## Example

```typescript
const contract = getShieldedContract({
  abi: myContractAbi,
  address: '0x1234...',
  client: shieldedWalletClient,
});

// Perform a shielded write
await contract.write.myFunction([arg1, arg2], { gas: 50000n });

// Perform a signed read
const value = await contract.sread.getValue();
console.log('Value:', value);
```

## Remarks

- The `write` property allows dynamic invocation of `nonpayable` and `payable` functions.
- The `read` property will toggle between public reads and signed reads, depending on whether an `account` is provided
- The `sread` property does the same as `read`, except provides `account` as a parameter (so it always makes a signed read)
- The client must be a `ShieldedWalletClient` or provide a wallet client for shielded-specific operations.
