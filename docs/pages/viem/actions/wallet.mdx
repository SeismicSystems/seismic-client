# Shielded Wallet Actions

In addition to all standard viem WalletClient methods, the ShieldedWalletClient provides several privacy-preserving features:

## signedReadContract

```ts
const result = await walletClient.signedReadContract({
  address: '0x1234...',
  abi: contractAbi,
  functionName: 'balanceOf',
  args: ['0xabcd...'],
})
```

Performs a signed read operation from a contract.

## shieldedWriteContract

```ts
const hash = await walletClient.shieldedWriteContract({
  address: '0x1234...',
  abi: contractAbi,
  functionName: 'transfer',
  args: ['0xabcd...', 100n],
})
```

Executes a contract write with encrypted calldata.

## getEncryption

```ts
const { aesKey, ecdhPubKey } = walletClient.getEncryption()
```

Retrieves the encryption keys currently in use by the client.
