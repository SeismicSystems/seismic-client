# Contract Instance

A ShieldedContract instance is a type-safe interface for performing contract-related actions on the Seismic blockchain. Create an instance with the `getShieldedContract` function.

## Import

```ts
import { getShieldedContract } from 'seismic-viem'
```

## Usage

You can create a ShieldedContract instance with the `getShieldedContract` function by passing in an ABI, address, and a [ShieldedWalletClient](/viem/clients/wallet).

```ts
const contract = getShieldedContract({
  address: '0x1234...',
  abi: myContractAbi,
  client: shieldedWalletClient,
})

// Perform a shielded write
await contract.write.myFunction([arg1, arg2], { gas: 50000n })

// Perform a signed read
const value = await contract.read.getValue()
console.log('Value:', value)
```

## Return Value

ShieldedContract instance object with type inferred from the ABI.

Depending on the client you provide, different methods will be available on the contract instance:

### Available Methods

- **`write`**: Write to a contract with encrypted calldata
- **`read`**: Read from a contract using a signed read
- **`tread`**: Transparently read from a contract using an unsigned read (from the zero address)
- **`twrite`**: Transparently write to a contract using non-encrypted calldata

### Calling Methods

Contract instance methods follow this general format:

```ts
// function calls
contract.(read|write|tread|twrite).(functionName)(args, options)
```

If the contract function doesn't accept arguments, you can set the `args` parameter to an empty array `[]`

## Parameters

### address

- **Type:** `Address` (`0x${string}`)

The contract address.

```ts
const contract = getShieldedContract({
  address: '0x1234...', // [!code focus]
  abi: myContractAbi,
  client: shieldedWalletClient,
})
```

### abi

- **Type:** `Abi`

The contract's ABI.

```ts
const contract = getShieldedContract({
  address: '0x1234...',
  abi: myContractAbi, // [!code focus]
  client: shieldedWalletClient,
})
```

### client

- **Type:** `ShieldedWalletClient`

The ShieldedWalletClient for performing contract actions with privacy features.

```ts
const contract = getShieldedContract({
  address: '0x1234...',
  abi: myContractAbi,
  client: shieldedWalletClient, // [!code focus]
})
```

## Remarks

- The `read` property will always call a signed read
- The `tread` property will toggle between public reads and signed reads, depending on whether an `account` is provided
- The `write` property will encrypt calldata of the transaction
- The `twrite` property will make a normal write with transparent calldata
- The client must be a `ShieldedWalletClient`

## Throws

- If the wallet client is not provided for shielded write or signed read operations
- If the wallet client does not have an account configured for signed reads
