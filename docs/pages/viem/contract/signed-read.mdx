# Signed Read Contract

Executes a signed read operation on a smart contract

## What is a signed read?

In Ethereum, anyone can read from a contract by impersonating any address, by specifying the `from` parameter in an `eth_call`.

On Seismic, this is not the case. If you perform a standard `eth_call` and set the `from` address, Seismic will ignore this input.

To read from a specific address, instead use a Signed Read, which sends a signed message to the `eth_call` endpoint. When the signature is verified, it will execute the underlying call, also providing the from address

The purpose of signed reads is to allow contract developers to check against `msg.sender` inside non-transactional contract calls knowing that these calls cannot be spoofed. Therefore the developer can conditionally reveal data inside a Solidity view function based on `msg.sender`.

## Import

```ts
import { signedReadContract } from 'seismic-viem'
```

## Usage

Executes a signed read operation on a smart contract.

A signed read is an operation unique to Seismic's blockchain. In Ethereum, users can make an eth_call and specify any `from` address. However, Seismic restricts this feature: any eth_call made to Seismic will have the from address overridden to zero. This is done so contract developers can check against `msg.sender` inside non-transactions knowing that these calls will not be spoofed.

To make a read that specifies a from address on Seismic, use signed reads. Essentially a signed read sends a signed, raw transaction to the eth_call endpoint. The msg.sender for the call is set to the transaction's signer.

```ts
const result = await signedReadContract(client, {
  abi: myContractAbi,
  functionName: 'balanceOf',
  address: '0x5678...',
  args: [],
})
console.log('Shielded balance:', result)
```

## Return Value

`Promise<unknown>` - A promise that resolves to the response from the contract.

## Parameters

### client

- **Type:** `ShieldedWalletClient`

The client used to execute the signed read operation. Must be a `ShieldedPublicClient` or `ShieldedWalletClient`.

```ts
// [!code focus:2]
const result = await signedReadContract(client, {
  abi: myContractAbi,
  functionName: 'balanceOf',
  address: '0x5678...',
})
```

### parameters

- **Type:** `SignedReadContractParameters`

The parameters for the read operation.

```ts
const result = await signedReadContract(client, {
  abi: myContractAbi, // [!code focus]
  functionName: 'balanceOf', // [!code focus]
  address: '0x5678...', // [!code focus]
  args: [], // [!code focus]
  // Additional options for customizing the call request
})
```

#### abi

- **Type:** `Abi`

The contract's ABI.

#### functionName

- **Type:** `string`

The name of the function to call.

#### args

- **Type:** `array`

The arguments for the function.

#### address

- **Type:** `Address`

The contract's address on the blockchain.

## Throws

If the account is not specified for the operation.

## Remarks

- If no `account` is specified in the parameters, the function defaults to using a standard read operation (`readContract`).
- Encodes the ABI parameters and function selector for shielded calls.
- Uses `signedCall` to securely sign and send the request.
- The `data` returned by the contract call is decoded based on the provided ABI.
