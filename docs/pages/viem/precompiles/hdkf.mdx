# hdfk

## Import

```ts
import { hdfk } from 'seismic-viem'
```

## Usage

Executes the HKDF (Hash-based Key Derivation Function) precompile to derive cryptographic keys from input material.

```ts
import { hdfk } from 'seismic-viem'
import { seismicDevnet } from 'seismic-viem'
import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem'

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: seismicDevnet,
  transport: http(),
})

// Using a string input
const derivedKey1 = await hdfk(client, 'my input string')
// Returns: '0x...' (32-byte derived key in hexadecimal format)

// Using a hex input
const derivedKey2 = await hdfk(client, '0x1234abcd5678ef90')
// Returns: '0x...' (32-byte derived key in hexadecimal format)
```

## Return Value

`Promise<'0x${string}'>` - A promise that resolves to the 32-byte derived key output of the HKDF precompile as a hexadecimal string.

## Parameters

### client

- **Type:** `CallClient`

The public client to use for the precompile call.

```ts
const derivedKey = await hdfk(client, 'input') // [!code focus]
```

### input

- **Type:** `string`

The input key material to the HKDF precompile, either as a plain string or hexadecimal value.

```ts
const derivedKey1 = await hdfk(client, 'my input string') // [!code focus]
const derivedKey2 = await hdfk(client, '0x1234abcd5678ef90') // [!code focus]
```

## Throws

May throw if the precompile call fails.

## Remarks

HKDF (Hash-based Key Derivation Function) is a cryptographic key derivation function that derives one or more keys from an input key material. In Seismic, this operation is performed through a precompile contract for efficiency.

This function is commonly used in cryptographic protocols to derive keys for encryption, authentication, and other security operations from a single shared secret.
